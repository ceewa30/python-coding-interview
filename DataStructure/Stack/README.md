A Stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In First-out (LIFO) or First-In Last-Out (FILO). In Stack a new element is added at one end (first) and removing the element in other end (last). The insert and delete operations are called Push and Pop.

The functions associated with stack are:
push() - Inserts the element at the top of the stack - Time Complexity O(1)
pop() - Deletes the element at the end fo the stack - Time Complexity O(1)
peek() - Returns the top element (reference) of the stack without removing it - Time ComplexityO(1)
size() -  Returns the size of the stack - Time Complexity O(1)
IsFull() - Check if the stack is full
empty() - Returns whether the stack is empty - Time Complexity O(1)

# Woring of Stack Data Structure

The operations work as follows:



Implementation of stack using python

* List
* Collections.deque
* queue.LifoQueue

# Disadvantage of Stack:

Restriction of size in Stack.
Stacks do not provide fast access to elements
Stacks do not support efficient searching.
